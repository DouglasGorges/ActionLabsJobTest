This repository contains my codes who Action Labs Co. asked me to do beeing a job interview part.

I do not know if it is the best way to do, but It works like they asked. This version was I have delivered:
https://github.com/DouglasGorges/ActionLabsJobTest/tree/fc69303d2211cff72ac820b1e0f600f8158aca56

After the deliver, I refactored the code to make it cleaner.

Action Labs is a company situed in Curitiba, Brazil.
My job interview was to work developing systems in a junior level.
